<h1>Using Large Language Models</h1>

<p>This assignment constitutes 30% of your final grade.  Please work
on the task individually.  Unless specifically requested otherwise,
your report may later be posted on-line with a CC-BY license.
<p><b>Deadline</b>: see <a href='index.html'>the main page</a>.


<h3>Create linguistic resources using one or more large language models</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create the following 3 resources (which would be useful for creating a sentiment analysis system like Vader)
    <ol>
      <li>A list of evaluative words in Czech, with English
      Translations, with a valence between +1 and -1, formatted as TSV
	(tab separated values).
<pre>	
skvělý	truly exceptional, outstanding	+1
dobrý	good, satisfactory, of a good standard	+0.7
fajn	okay, good enough, not bad	+0
špatný	bad, poor, of poor quality	-0.6
zlý	bad, evil, wicked	-0.7
otřesný	terrible, shocking, causing great distress	-0.9
</pre>
      <li>A list of boosters in Czech, with English translations, formatted as TSV
	<pre>
opravdu   really
velmi	  very
hodně     a lot
	</pre>
     <li>A list of diminishers in Czech, with English translations, formatted as TSV
	<pre>
docela     quite
trochu     a bit
poněkud    somewhat
celkem     fairly
    </ol>

</ul>
  <li>You should use at least two different LLMs
  <li>You should try multiple different queries
  <li>You should discuss which queries worked better with which systems and why (you need to date the query/response, as they change often)
  <li>You should try to get as many useful words (i.e. those with a valence not equal to zero) as you can
  <li>You can combine the results of different queries by hand, or try to use an LLM to do this
  <li>You can use the LLM to write part of the report, if you do, you should make clear which part and what the prompt was
  
    <p>You will be evaluated both on the quality of the resource you are able to build <strong>and</strong> the discussion of how you used the LLMs to build it.


<h3>Deliverable</h3>
<ul>

  <li>The deliverable is be a paper of no more than twelve pages
    including diagrams, prompts and references
    <ul>
      <li>Along with three files <b><tt>valence.tsv</tt>,  <tt>booster.tsv</tt>, <tt>diminisher.tsv</tt></b>.
      <li>zip them up in a file <b><tt>surname.zip</tt></b>
	
    </ul>
 <li>Make sure you include page numbers
  <li>Use single spacing.
  <li> Submit only <b>softcopy</b> 
</ul>
