<h1>Uncertain Communication</h1>

<p>This assignment constitutes 30% of your final grade.  Please work
on the task individually.  Unless specifically requested otherwise,
your report may later be posted on-line with a CC-BY license.
<p><b>Deadline</b>: see <a href='index.html'>the main page</a>.

<p>Chose one of A, B, C:

<ul>
  <!-- <li><b>A:</b> Examine some examples of <b>phishing mail</b>, either from -->
  <!-- your own experience or from a collection such as the <a href='http://www.monkey.org/~jose/wiki/doku.php?id=phishingcorpus'>Phishing -->
  <!-- Corpus</a>. -->
  <!-- Identify and describe, with examples, what kinds of grammatical, -->
  <!-- lexical, orthographic or meta-data features could be used to -->
  <!-- distinguish phishing mail from normal mail. -->
  <!--   <ul> -->
  <!--     <li>Summarize relevant literature on phishing detection -->
  <!--     <li>Describe how these features can be identified -->
  <!--     <li>Finally, write your own phishing mail, aimed at NTU -->
  <!--   students, trying to get their username and password, and describe -->
  <!--   how you have made it convincing. -->
  <!-- </ul> -->
  <li><b>A:</b> Examine some examples of <b>fake news</b>, either from
    your own experience or from a collection such as the
    <a href='http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/downloads.html#FakeNews'>Fake
  News Dataset</a>.
  Identify and describe, with examples, what kinds of grammatical,
  lexical, orthographic or meta-data features could be used to
  distinguish fake news from legitimate news.
    <ul>
      <li>Summarize relevant literature on fake news detection
      <li>Describe how these features can be identified
      <li>Finally, find one or more examples of fake news on a subject related
	to linguistics and describe how it can be identified as fake.
      <li> Think about how recent Singaporean legislation would treat this.
  </ul>
 <li><b>B:</b> Identify and describe a source of linguistic meta-data 
  (at any level: phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic or pragmatic)
  that could be harvested from the Internet. 
   <ul>
     <li> words that rhyme harvested from poetry
     <li> positive or negative sentiment from reviews
     <li> multilingual/bilingual data
   </ul>
 <ol>
  <li>Show what property or properties are annotated by the meta-data, with examples
  <li>Outline how the data could be harvested and pre-processed
    <br> optionally, harvest and pre-process some.
  <li>Estimate how much annotated data is available
  <li>You should chose a new source of data, not one that is already
    described in the literature 
    (although you can make a variation on an existing approach)
 </ol>
 <li> <b>C:</b> Analyze the <a href='chat.html'>chat corpus</a> provided here. 
   <ul>
     <li> Identify expressions unique to chat/online communication and
     suggest why they are used here.
     <li> Refer to expressions by date, time and where necessary,
     participant (e.g. Mon 20:40 <B>S</B>)
   </ul>

   <br>This corpus was produced and anonymized by Lim Hogzhen as part
   of her FYP <i>A comparison of Code-switching Patterns between
   Text-Messaging and Speech</i> in 2014.  The participants agreed to
   release it under a
   <a href='creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/sg'>creative commons
   attribution license</a>.  The two participants are <i>Samantha</i>
   (not her real name) and <i>Ophelia</i> (not her real name) both
   Singaporean undergraduate students at NTU (female; age between
   20-25; both use a mixture of Chinese and English).  There is some
   mark-up of code switching (e.g. &lt;ra:w:n&gt; and bolding or
   underlining: you can just ignore it).  
 </ul>

<p>Whichever topic you choose you should find and cite relevant literature.

  <p>Do not go actually phish for people's passwords or post the fake
  news (unless it is clearly identified as such).

<h3>Deliverable</h3>
<ul>

  <li>The deliverable is be a paper of no more than eight pages including diagrams and
    references
  <li>Formatted according to
  the <a href='http://www.soh.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes/linguistics/studentresources/Documents/Linguistics%20Assignment%20Guidelines.pdf'>LMS
  guidelines</a> to submitting written work for the Division of LMS
  (but see below).

  <li>If you want to make it even more beautiful, as I am sure you do,
  take a look at my <a href =
  "http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/fcbond/data/ling-style.pdf">(Computational)
  Linguistic Style Guidelines</a>: a guide for the flummoxed.
  <li> Submit only <b>softcopy</b> (via NTULearn).
