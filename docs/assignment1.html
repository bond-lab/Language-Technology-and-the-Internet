<h1>Analysis of a medium of communication</h1>

<p>This assignment constitutes 20% of your final grade.  Please work
on the task individually.  Unless specifically requested otherwise,
your report will be posted on-line with a CC-BY license.
<p><b>Deadline</b>: see <a href="index.html">main page</a>.

<p>Describe one medium of communication not discussed in class and
compare it to both speech and text.  (So you should not discuss:
face-to-face conversation, book publication, telephone conversation,
email, blogs, chat or wikis.) 

<ul>
  <li>The medium can be something new (like Twitter) 
    or something old (like Semaphore) 
  <li>Describe the medium and give some statistics as to how widely it is/was used
  <li>Summarize relevant literature on the medium 
  <li>Describe how the properties of the medium 
    affect the language used to communicate 
  <li>Describe what new kinds of communication the medium has enabled (if
any) and its general effects on language and society (if any) 
  <li>You may wish to use Herring's (2007) faceted classification
scheme for computer-mediated discourse (but don't have to)
 <li> You may use the seven features introduced by Crystal (2006, Ch 3â€“6) 
  <table>
   <tr><th>Speech like</th><th>Text like</th></tr>
   <tr><td>time bound</td><td>space bound</td></tr>
   <tr><td>spontaneous</td><td>contrived</td></tr>
   <tr><td>face-to-face</td><td>visually decontextualized</td></tr>
   <tr><td>loosely structured</td><td>elaborately structured</td></tr>
   <tr><td>socially interactive</td><td>factually communicative</td></tr>  
   <tr><td>immediately revisable</td><td>repeatedly revisable</td></tr>
   <tr><td>prosodically rich</td><td>graphically rich</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>


<h3>Deliverable</h3>
<ul>

  <li>The deliverable is be a paper of six to eight pages including diagrams and
    references
   <li>Make sure you include page numbers
   <li>Use single spacing.
   <li> Include the author and title, but not on a separate page.
  <li>If you want to make it even more beautiful, as I am sure you do,
  take a look at my <a href = 'https://fcbond.github.io/static/img/ling-style.pdf'>(Computational)
  Linguistic Style Guidelines</a>: a guide for the flummoxed.
  <li> Submit <b>softcopy</b> only.
  <li>What I look for when I mark:
    <ul>
      <li>Good choice of medium: has it been described before, is
	there something interesting linguistically to say about it
      <li>Description of medium: do you give statistics of its use;
      are there examples, especially of interesting linguistic
      phenomena; is your description neutral 
      <li>Linguistic analysis: Is your analysis correct; can you back
      your analysis up with examples and/or references
      <li>Position in a wider context: are the linguistic features
      similar to those in other media and if so why; how does this
      effect communication more generally
      <li>Overall readability: do you have a clear title and
      structure, is your name clearly visible; are there many careless
      mistakes; do you define new terms clearly
</ul>
