# HG2052 Language Technology and the Internet

This course explores the intersection of language, technology and the
internet.  We start by looking at the introduction of writing and how
it can be represented on computers.  We then look at speech and how it
differs from text.  These are compared to different media of
communication such as email, blogs and chat.  The internet has made
new methods of writing possible, as well as made access to an
incredible variety and amount of text.  We study how wikipedia pages
are written, and students group together to write their own pages.  In
the second half of the course, we learn about how information is
represented electronically, both as text and meta-text.  We finish
with a description of the semantic web and citation networks. The
implications of this technology for our thinking and understanding of
language will also be discussed.

This course is created by Francis Bond.
