# HG2052 Language Technology and the Internet

This course explores the impact of technology on everyday use of language. The focus is on modern information technology, but the course will begin with a review of some 'old' technology (e.g. writing, typing, sound recording, radio and television) in order to show how all technology can potentially change language use. Like so many other aspects of life, language communication has been revolutionised by the introduction of the Internet. We will look at the structure and use of English have been shaped by the popularity of new modes of communication made available by the Internet: SMS, e-mail, chatrooms, Internet Relay Chat, Usenet newsgroups, World Wide Web pages, and virtual worlds. The implications of these changes for our thinking and understanding of language will also be discussed.
