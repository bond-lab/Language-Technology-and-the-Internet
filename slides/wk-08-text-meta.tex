  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{quotation} 
  It wasn't long before webmasters with no scruples saw an opportunity to gain favour with the search engines by adding in keywords that did not pertain to the content of their pages. Various tactics were thought up to get ranked higher for certain keywords, and an entire industry sprang up to optimise search engine positioning. This was, in effect, cheating, and ``keyword spamming'' became a serious problem for search engines, who vainly attempted to add filters that would notice when a webmaster was loading up on the wrong keywords.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  People lie
\item  People are lazy

\item  Schemas aren't neutral
\item  Metrics influence results
\item  There's more than one way to describe something

\myslide{Cory Doctorow}
\MyLogo{https://xkcd.com/239/}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../pics/blagofaire.png}

A Canadian-British blogger, journalist, and science fiction author who
serves as co-editor of the blog Boing Boing. He is an activist in
favour of liberalising copyright laws and a proponent of the Creative
Commons organization, using some of their licences for his books. Some
common themes of his work include digital rights management, file
sharing, and post-scarcity economics. (Wikipedia) 

\myslide{People lie}

Metadata exists in a competitive world. Suppliers compete to sell
their goods, cranks compete to convey their crackpot theories (mea
culpa), artists compete for audience.

Thus:
\begin{itemize}
\item    A search for any commonly referenced term at a search-engine like Altavista will often turn up at least one porn link in the first ten results.
\item     Your mailbox is full of spam with subject lines like "Re: The information you requested."
\item     Publisher's Clearing House sends out advertisements that holler "You may already be a winner!"
\item     Press-releases have gargantuan lists of empty buzzwords attached
\end{itemize}

\myslide{People are lazy}

Here in the Info-Ivory-Tower, we understand the importance of creating
and maintaining excellent metadata for our information.

But info-civilians are remarkably cavalier about their
information. Your clueless aunt sends you email with no subject line,
half the pages on Geocities are called "Please title this page" and
your boss stores all of his files on his desktop with helpful titles
like "UNTITLED.DOC."

\myslide{People are stupid}

Even when there's a positive benefit to creating good metadata, people
steadfastly refuse to exercise care and diligence in their metadata
creation.

Take eBay: every seller there has a damned good reason for
double-checking their listings for typos and misspellings. Try
searching for "plam" on eBay. Right now, that turns up nine typoed
listings for "Plam Pilots." Misspelled listings don't show up in
correctly-spelled searches and hence garner fewer bids and lower
sale-prices. You can almost always get a bargain on a Plam Pilot at
eBay.

The fine (and gross) points of literacy -- spelling, punctuation,
grammar -- elude the vast majority of the Internet's users. To believe
that J. Random Users will suddenly and en masse learn to spell and
punctuate -- let alone accurately categorize their information
according to whatever hierarchy they're supposed to be using -- is
self-delusion of the first water.

\myslide{Mission: Impossible -- know thyself}

In meta-utopia, everyone engaged in the heady business of describing
stuff carefully weighs the stuff in the balance and accurately divines
the stuff's properties, noting those results.

Simple observation demonstrates the fallacy of this assumption. When
Nielsen used log-books to gather information on the viewing habits of
their sample families, the results were heavily skewed to Masterpiece
Theater and Sesame Street. Replacing the journals with set-top boxes
that reported what the set was actually tuned to showed what the
average American family was really watching: light entertainment.

People are lousy observers of their own behaviors. Entire religions
are formed with the goal of helping people understand themselves
better; therapists rake in billions working for this very end.


\myslide{Schemas aren't neutral}

In a given sub-domain, say, Washing Machines, experts agree on
sub-hierarchies, with classes for reliability, energy consumption,
color, size, etc.

Nothing could be farther from the truth. Any hierarchy of ideas necessarily implies the importance of some axes over others. A manufacturer of small, environmentally conscious washing machines would draw a hierarchy that looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Energy consumption:
    Water consumption:
        Size:
            Capacity:
                Reliability:

\end{verbatim}
\newpage
While a manufacturer of glitzy, feature-laden washing machines would want something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Color:
    Size:
        Programmability:
            Reliability:
\end{verbatim}

The conceit that competing interests can come to easy accord on a common vocabulary totally ignores the power of organizing principles in a marketplace.

\myslide{Metrics influence results}

Ranking axes are mutually exclusive: software that scores high for
security scores low for convenience, desserts that score high for
decadence score low for healthiness. Every player in a metadata
standards body wants to emphasize their high-scoring axes and
de-emphasize (or, if possible, ignore altogether) their low-scoring
axes.

It's wishful thinking to believe that a group of people competing to
advance their agendas will be universally pleased with any hierarchy
of knowledge. The best that we can hope for is a detente in which
everyone is equally miserable.

\myslide{There's more than one way to describe something}

"No, I'm not watching cartoons! It's cultural anthropology."

"This isn't smut, it's art."

"It's not plagiarism, it's borrowing!''

Reasonable people can disagree forever on how to describe something. Arguably, your Self is the collection of associations and descriptors you ascribe to ideas. Requiring everyone to use the same vocabulary to describe their material denudes the cognitive landscape, enforces homogeneity in ideas.

And that's just not right. 


\myslide{So how can we get metadata?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Look for visible metadata (you can check)
\item Look for structural metadata (from the system)
\item Look for implicit metadata

\end{itemize}

\myslide{Keywords and Categories}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sites with \emp{visible tags} are more trustworthy/reliable
\item Tags within blogs/photo cites
\item Keywords in journals and conferences

\begin{itemize}
\item An article's vote is weighted according to its
  citation impact. 
\item This  can be formalized in a well-defined way and calculated.

  masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.
\item Communications typically pretend to be from social web sites, auction sites, online payment processors or IT administrators.
\item Phishing is typically carried out by e-mail spoofing, linking
  users to a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical
  to the legitimate one.
\item Phishing is an example of social engineering.
\item A phishing technique was described in detail in 1987, and (according to its creator) the first recorded use of the term \textit{phishing} was made in 1995.

  \item   Satire, Hoax, Propoganda vs real news
  \item Ratio of appearance in fake to real news
  \end{itemize}
\item We can identify things likely to be fake news just from the
  language
\item But the single most useful piece of evidence (feature) is the
  source --- where it comes from

\MyLogo{\url{https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/19/spam-junk-slop-the-latest-wave-of-ai-behind-the-zombie-internet}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{slop} is the new name for unwanted AI-generated content (like \txx{spam} for email)
\item Mindlessly generated content presented as real content
\item We used to have content farms, where poorly paid people create fake accounts, web pages and news
\item Now AI can do it faster and cheaper!
  
\end{itemize}

\MyLogo{\url{https://www.404media.co/email/24eb6cea-6fa6-4b98-a2d2-8c4ba33d6c04/}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Jason Koebler looks at AI generated pages on facebook, which are then often full of AI bots commenting on them, \ldots

\item For example: \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{../pics/AI-jesus.png}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Amen 
  \item Amin 
  \item Happy birthday 
  \item Thank you Lord Amen happy birthday
  \end{itemize}
\item But sometimes pictures fool people, and real people waste time discussing them
  
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item An AI chatbot called “FungiFriend” joined mushroom identification Facebook group
\item a user asked “how do you cook Sarcosphaera coronaria,” a type of mushroom that was once thought edible but is now known to hyperaccumulate arsenic and has caused a documented death
\item FungiFriend told the member that it is “edible but rare,” and said “cooking methods mentioned by some enthusiasts include sautéing in butter, adding to soups or stews, and pickling.”
\item This was a bot created and run by META, Facebook's parent company!

\myslide{What to Do?}

\begin{itemize}
\item be vigilant
\item look at metadata
\item look at implicit metadata
\item be ethical
  \begin{itemize}
  \item don't create slop

  \end{itemize}
\item push for others to do the same
\item look for human-centric media
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Blue Sky
  \item Blogs
  \item Substack with authors you can trust
  \item Newspapers! 
  \end{itemize}
