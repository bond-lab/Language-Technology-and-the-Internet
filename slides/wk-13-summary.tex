\section{Revision}


\myslide{Language and Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item The two things that separate humans from animals \citep[\S1.1]{Sproat:2010}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Language
    \begin{itemize}
    \item large vocabulary (10,000+)
    \item complicated syntax (no upper length; recursion; embedding)
    \end{itemize}

  \item Technology
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Widespread tool use
    \item Widespread tool manufacture
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item Speech --- the start of language 
\item Writing --- the first great intersection
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Language and the Internet}

\begin{itemize}
\item New forms of communication
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Neither speech nor text
  \item Massively interactive
  \end{itemize}
\item Extremely rapid change
\item A first hand narrative (I was online before the internet :-)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item but I am probably behind you all now
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{New forms}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Email (from PC, phone, other)
\item Chat; Usenet
\item Virtual Worlds
\item WWW
\item Blogs (overlap)
\item Facebook, LinkedIn
\item Wikis
\item Twitter
\end{itemize}




\section{Representing Language}

\begin{itemize}
\item Writing Systems
\item Encodings
\item Speech
\item Bandwidth
\end{itemize}


\myslide{What is represented?}
%%% FIXME
\begin{itemize}
\item \ul{\blu{Phonemes}}:  \ipa{/maɪ dɒg laɪks ˈɒrɪnʤɪz/}  \com{45}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Not a  simple correspondence between a writing system
    and the sounds
  \item Some logographs (\textit{3}, \textit{@}, \textit{\$})
  \item Even when a new alphabet is designed, pronunciation changes.
  \end{itemize}
\item Syllables:  \ipa{maɪ dɒg laɪks (ˈɒr)(ɪn)(ʤɪz)}  \com{10,000+}
\item Morphemes: my/me+'s dog like+s orange+s \com{100,000+}
\item Words: \eng{my dog likes oranges} \com{200,000+}
\item Concepts: \iz{speaker poss dog$_{canine}$:SG fond orange$_{fruit}$:PL}  \com{400,000++}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Three Major Writing Systems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alphabetic (Latin)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  one symbol for consonant or vowel
  \item Typically 20-30 base symbols (1 byte)
  \end{itemize}
\item Syllabic (Hiragana)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  one symbol for each syllable (consonant+vowel)
  \item Typically 50-100 base symbols (1-2 bytes)
  \end{itemize}
\item Logographic (Hanzi)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item pictographs, ideographs, sounds-meaning combinations
  \item Typically 10,0000+ symbols (2-3 bytes)
  \end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
\myslide{Computational Encoding}

\begin{itemize}
\item Need to map characters to bits
\item More characters require more space
  \begin{itemize}
  \item English: ASCII (7 bits); Western Europe: ISO-8859-1 (8 bits); 
    \\ Japanese: EUC (16 bits); Everything: UTF-8 (8-32 bits)
  \end{itemize}
\item Moving towards unicode for everything
\item If you get the encoding wrong, it is gibberish
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Web pages should state their encoding
  \item Sometimes they are wrong
  \item \blu{Encoding Detection}  usually involves statistical analysis of byte patterns
    \begin{itemize}
    \item But an encoding can be shared by many languages
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}




\section{Speech and Language Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item The need for speech representation
\item Storing sound
\item Transforming Speech
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \blu{Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)}: sounds to text
  \item \blu{Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS)}: texts to sounds
  \end{itemize}
\item Speech technology --- the Telephone!
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Why is it so difficult?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pronunciation depends on context
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The same word will be pronounced differently in different sentences
  \end{itemize}
\item Speaker variability
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Gender
  \item Dialect/Foreign Accent
  \item Individual Differences: Physical differences; Language differences (idiolect)‏
  \end{itemize}
\item Many, many rare events
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 300 out of 2000 diphones in the core set for the AT\&T NextGen system occur only once in a 2-hour speech database
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Two steps in a TTS system}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Linguistic Analysis
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sentence Segmentation
  \item Abbreviations: \eng{Dr Smith lives on Nanyang Dr. He is \ldots}
  \item Word Segmentation:

    \item[\Bad]  森山 前日 銀 総裁　\jpn{Moriyama zennichi gin Sousai}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\item Speech Synthesis
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Find the pronunciation
  \item Generate sounds
  \item Add intonation
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\myslide{Speech Synthesis}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \blu{Articulatory Synthesis:} Attempt to model human articulation.
  \item \blu{Formant Synthesis:} Bypass modeling of human articulation, and model acoustics directly.
  \item \blu{Concatenative Synthesis:} Synthesize from stored units of actual speech
  \end{itemize}
  
\myslide{Prosody of Emotion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Excitement: Fast, very high pitch, loud
\item Hot anger: Fast, high pitch, strong, falling accent, loud
\item Fear: Jitter
\item Sarcasm: Prolonged accent, late peak
\item Sad: Slow, low pitch
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
  The main determinant of ``naturalness'' in speech synthesis is not
  ``voice quality'', but natural-sounding prosody (intonation and
  duration)

\item [Unlinked content] pages which are not linked to by other pages (but clicking links them)
\item [Private Web] sites that require registration and login \com{Edventure}
\item [Contextual Web] pages with content varying for different access contexts (e.g., ranges of client IP addresses or previous navigation sequence).
\item [Limited access content] sites that limit access to their pages

\section{The Web as Corpus}
\myslide{Two Approaches to using the Web as a Corpus}
\begin{itemize}
\item \blu{Direct Query}: Search Engine as Query tool and WWW as corpus?
\\  (Objection: Results are not reliable)
\begin{itemize}
\item Population and exact hit counts are unknown → no statistics
possible.
\item Indexing does not allow to draw conclusions on the data.
\item[\Bad] Google is missing functionalities that linguists /
lexicographers would like to have.
\end{itemize}
\item \blu{Web Sample}: Use search engine to download data from the
net and build a corpus from it.
\begin{itemize}
\item known size and exact hit counts → statistics possible.
\item people can draw conclusions over the included text types.
\item (limited) control over the content.
\item[\Bad] sparser data
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Direct Query}
\begin{itemize}
\item Accessible through search engines (Google API, Yahoo API, Scripts)

\item Document counts are shown to correlate directly with ``real''
  frequencies (Keller 2003), so search engines can help - but...
  \begin{itemize}
  \item lots of repetitions of the same text (not representative)
  \item very limited query precision (no upper/lower case, no punctuation...)
  \item only estimated counts, often hard to reproduce exactly
  \item different queries give wildly different numbers
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Web Count Units}
\MyLogo{http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000953.html}

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
\item \blu{ghit} or ``google hit'' is the most common unit used to
  count web snippets (in the early 2000s)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item it is document frequency not term frequency
  \end{itemize}
\item \blu{whit} or ``web hit'' is the more general term
\item Normally you compare two phenomena to get a unitless ratio
  \\(e.g. \eng{different from} vs \eng{different than})
  \\ 251,000,000 ghits vs 71,500,000 or \emp{3.5:1} (accessed 2012-04-04)
%(/ 251 71.5) 3.5104895104895104
\item \blu{GPB}, for ``Ghits per billion documents'' is good if want a
  more stable number (suggested by Mark Liberman)
\\ but Google no longer releases the index size 
\item So always say when you counted, and try to use ratios
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Web Sample}
\MyLogo{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extracting and filtering web documents to create linguistically
  annotated corpora (Kilgarriff 2006)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item gather documents for different topics (balance!)
  \item exclude documents which cannot be preprocessed with available
    tools (here taggers and lemmatizers)
  \item exclude documents which seem irrelevant for a corpus (too short or
    too long, word lists,...)
  \item do this for several languages and make the corpora available
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Building Internet Corpora: Outline}

\item Select Seed Words (500)
\item Combine to form multiple queries (6,000)

\myslide{XML: eXtensible Markup Language}

\begin{itemize}
\item XML is a set of rules for encoding documents electronically.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item is a markup language much like HTML
  \item was designed to \blu{carry data, not to display data}
  \item tags are not predefined. You must define your own tags
  \item is designed to be \blu{self-descriptive}
  \item XML is a W3C Recommendation
  \end{itemize}
  \item Can be validated for syntactic well-formedness
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Semantic Web Architecture (details)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify things with  \blu{Uniform Resource Identifiers}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \blu{Universal Resource Name}: \url{urn:isbn:1575864606}
  \item \blu{Universal Resource Locator}: \url{http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/fcbond/}
  \end{itemize}
\item Identify relations with  \blu{Resource Description Framework}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Triples of $<$subject, predicate, object$>$
  \item Each element is a \emp{URI}
  \item RDFs are written in well defined XML
  \item You can say anything about anything
  \end{itemize}
\item You can build relations in ontologies (\blu{OWL})
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Then reason over them, search them, \ldots
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\myslide{Criticism of the Semantic Web}
\MyLogo{\url{http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm}}
Doctorow's seven insurmountable obstacles to reliable metadata are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  People lie
\item  People are lazy
\item  People are stupid
\item  Mission Impossible: know thyself
\item  Schemas aren't neutral
\item  Metrics influence results
\item  There's more than one way to describe something
\end{enumerate}

\myslide{Semantic Web and NLP}
\MyLogo{}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Semantic Web is about structuring data
\item Text Mining is about unstructured data
\item There is \blu{much more unstructured than structured data}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item NLP can infer structure
  \item NLP makes the Semantic Web feasible
  \item the Semantic Web can be a resource for NLP
  \end{itemize}

\section{Citation, Reputation and PageRank}

\myslide{Citation Networks}

\begin{itemize}
\item How can we tell what is a good scientific paper?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \blu{Content-based}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Read it and see if it is interesting (hard for a computer)
    \item Compare it to other things you have read and liked
    \end{itemize}
  \item     \blu{Context based}: \textbf{Citation Analysis}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item See who else read and thought it interesting enough to cite
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Reputation and Citation Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item One major use of citation networks is in measuring productivity
  and impact of the published work of a scientist, scholar or research
  group
\item Some scores are
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Total Number of Citations \hfill (\emp{Pretty Useful})
  \item Total Number of Citations minus Self-citations
  \item Total Number of (Citations / Number of Authors)
  \item Average (Citation * Impact Factor / Number of Authors)
  \end{itemize}
\item Problems
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Not all citations are equal: citations by `good' papers are better
  \item Newer publications suffer in relation to older ones
  \end{itemize}
\item Weight Citations by Quality of the paper
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Gaming Citations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Least/Minimum Publishable Unit
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Break research into small chunks to  increase the number of citations
  \item Sometimes there is very little new information
  \end{itemize}
\item Self citation, in-group citation
\item Write only proceedings (some journals are not often read)
\item Submitting only to High Impact factor journals
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
  You improve what gets measured \\
not necessarily what you want to improve
\end{center}

\myslide{Characteristics of the Web: Bow Tie}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.8\textheight]{../pics/web-bowtie-bw.eps}  
\end{center}
\blu{SCC}: Strongly Connected Core --- can travel from any page to any page


\myslide{Anchor Text}

\begin{itemize}
\item Recall how hyperlinks are written: \vspace{-1ex}
\begin{verbatim}
<a href="http://path.to.there/page/HG803/">HG803: 
Language, Technology and the Internet.</a>
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
For more information about Language, Technology and the
Internet, see the <a href="http://..">HG803 Course Page.</a>
\end{verbatim}
\item Link analysis builds on two intuitions:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The hyperlink from A to B represents an endorsement of page B, by the creator of page A.

  \item The (extended) anchor text pointing to page B is a good description of page B.
  \end{enumerate}
  \small {This is not always the case; for instance, most corporate websites have a pointer from every page to a page containing a copyright notice.}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{PageRank as Citation analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Citation frequency can be used to measure
  the \blu{impact} of an article.
\begin{itemize}
\item Simplest measure: Each article gets one vote -- not
  very accurate.
\end{itemize}
\item On the web: citation frequency = \blu{inlink count}
\begin{itemize}
\item A high inlink count does not necessarily
  mean high quality \ldots
\item \ldots mainly because of link spam.
\end{itemize}
\item Better measure: \blu{weighted} citation frequency or citation rank
\begin{itemize}
\item An article's vote is weighted according to its
  citation impact. 
\item This  can be formalized in a   well-defined way and calculated.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{PageRank as Random walk}
\begin{itemize}
\item Imagine a web surfer doing a random walk on the web
\begin{itemize}
\item Start at a random page
\item At each step, go out of the current page along one of
  the links on that page, equiprobably
\end{itemize}
\item In the steady state, each page has a \blu{long-term visit rate}.
  \\ what proportion of the time someone will be there
\item This long-term visit rate is the page's \blu{PageRank}.
\item \blu{PageRank 
=
  long-term visit rate
= steady state robability 
}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Teleporting -- to get us out of dead ends}
\begin{itemize}
\item At a \blu{dead end}, jump to a random web page with
  probability $1/N$.
\\ ~   \hfill ($N$ is the total number of web pages)
\item At a \blu{non-dead end}, with probability 10\%, jump to a
  random web page (to each with a probability of $0.1/N$).
\item With remaining probability (90\%), go out on a random
  hyperlink.
\begin{itemize}
 \item For example, if the page has 4 outgoing links:
   randomly choose one with probability (1-0.10)/4=0.225
\end{itemize}
\item 10\% is a parameter, the \blu{teleportation rate}.
\item Note: ``jumping'' from a dead end is
independent of teleportation rate.
\end{itemize}

Pages with higher PageRanks are lighter. 

\myslide{Gaming PageRank}
\MyLogo{}
\begin{itemize}
\item \blu{Link Spam} adding links between pages for reasons other
  than merit.  Link spam takes advantage of link-based ranking
  algorithms, which gives websites higher rankings the more other
  highly ranked websites link to it.  Examples include adding links
  within blogs.
\item \blu{Link Farms} creating tightly-knit communities of pages
  referencing each other, also known humorously as mutual admiration
  societies.
\item \blu{Scraper Sites}  "scrape" search-engine results pages or other sources of content and create "content" for a website. The specific presentation of content on these sites is unique, but is merely an amalgamation of content taken from other sources, often without permission.
\newpage
\item \blu{Comment spam} is a form of link spam in web pages that
  allow dynamic user editing such as wikis, blogs, and guestbooks.
  Agents can be written that automatically randomly select a user
  edited web page, such as a Wikipedia article, and add spamming
  links.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[!] The \blu{nofollow} link: a value that can be assigned to the rel
attribute of an HTML hyperlink to instruct some search engines that a
hyperlink should not influence the link target's ranking in the search
  engine's index.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Google does not index the target of a link marked \textbf{nofollow}.
  \item Yahoo! does not include the link in its ranking
  \item \ldots
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Current Status}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is a continuous battle between 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Search companies, who want to get the most useful page to the user
  \item Page writers, who want to get their page read
  \end{itemize}
\item \emp{All metrics get gamed}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Digital object identifier}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \blu{DOI}: a string used to uniquely identify an electronic document or object
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Metadata  about the object is stored with the DOI name
  \item The metadata includes a location, such as a URL
  \item The DOI for a document is permanent,  the metadata may change
  \item Gives a Persistent Identifier (like ISBN)
  \end{itemize}
\item  The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the International DOI Foundation
\item By late 2009 approximately 43 million DOI names had been assigned by some 4,000 organizations
\begin{itemize}
\item DOI: \emp{10.1007/s10579-008-9062-z} 
\\ \url{http://www.springerlink.com/content/v7q114033401th5u/}
