\item The need for speech representation
\item Storing sound
\item Transforming Speech
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \blu{Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)}: sounds to text
  \item \blu{Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS)}: texts to sounds

\myslide{How good are the systems in 2020?}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
  English Tasks &  WER\% \\

LibriSpeech audiobooks 960hour clean  & 1.4 \\
LibriSpeech audiobooks 960hour other  & 2.6 \\
Switchboard telephone conversations between strangers & 5.8 \\
CALLHOME telephone conversations between family & 11.0 \\
Sociolinguistic interviews, CORAAL (AAL) & 27.0 \\
CHiMe5 dinner parties with body-worn microphones & 47.9 \\

Chinese (Mandarin) Tasks &   CER\% \\ \hline
AISHELL-1 Mandarin read speech corpus & 6.7 \\
HKUST Mandarin Chinese telephone conversations &  23.5 \\
\end{tabular}

Rough Word Error Rates (WER = \% of words misrecognized) reported
around 2020 for ASR on various American English and Chinese
recognition tasks.

Note, the error rate for transcribing
conversations between humans is much higher; 5.8 to 11\% for the
Switchboard and CALLHOME corpora.
\citep[Ch.~16, p4]{Jurafsky:Martin:2023}


\myslide{Why is ASR so difficult?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Speaker variability
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Gender
  \item Dialect/Foreign Accent
  \item Individual Differences: Physical differences; Language differences (idiolect)‏
  \end{itemize}
\item Many, many rare events
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 300 out of 2000 diphones in the core set for the AT\&T NextGen system occur only once in a 2-hour speech database
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


  
\myslide{Prosody of Emotion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Excitement: Fast, very high pitch, loud
\item Hot anger: Fast, high pitch, strong, falling accent, loud
\item Fear: Jitter
\item Sarcasm: Prolonged accent, late peak
\item Sad: Slow, low pitch
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Moderation}
\MyLogo{\url{http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006036.html}}

Teresa Nielsen Hayden (2005) \textit{Virtual panel participation}


Some things I know about moderating conversations in virtual space:

\begin{enumerate}
\item There can be no ongoing discourse without some degree of moderation, if only to kill off the hardcore trolls. It takes rather more moderation than that to create a complex, nuanced, civil discourse. If you want that to happen, you have to give of yourself. Providing the space but not tending the conversation is like expecting that your front yard will automatically turn itself into a garden.

\item Once you have a well-established online conversation space, with enough regulars to explain the local mores to newcomers, they'll do a lot of the policing themselves.
\item You own the space. You host the conversation. You don't own the community. Respect their needs. For instance, if you're going away for a while, don't shut down your comment area. Give them an open thread to play with, so they'll still be there when you get back.
\item Message persistence rewards people who write good comments.

\item Over-specific rules are an invitation to people who get off on gaming the system.
\item  Civil speech and impassioned speech are not opposed and mutually exclusive sets. Being interesting trumps any amount of conventional politeness.
\item Things to cherish: Your regulars. A sense of community. Real expertise. Genuine engagement with the subject under discussion. Outstanding performances. Helping others. Cooperation in maintenance of a good conversation. Taking the time to teach newbies the ropes.
All these things should be rewarded with your attention and praise. And if you get a particularly good comment, consider adding it to the original post.
\item Grant more lenience to participants who are only part-time jerks, as long as they're valuable the rest of the time.
\item If you judge that a post is offensive, upsetting, or just plain unpleasant, it's important to get rid of it, or at least make it hard to read. Do it as quickly as possible. There's no more useless advice than to tell people to just ignore such things. We can't. We automatically read what falls under our eyes.
\item  Another important rule: You can let one jeering, unpleasant jerk hang around for a while, but the minute you get two or more of them egging each other on, they both have to go, and all their recent messages with them. There are others like them prowling the net, looking for just that kind of situation. More of them will turn up, and they'll encourage each other to behave more and more outrageously. Kill them quickly and have no regrets.
\item  You can't automate intelligence. In theory, systems like Slashdot's ought to work better than they do. Maintaining a conversation is a task for human beings.
\item Disemvowelling works. Consider it.
%%% fixe me: add example
\item If someone you've disemvowelled comes back and behaves, forgive and forget their earlier gaffes. You're acting in the service of civility, not abstract justice.
\end{enumerate}

1. 3- FACETED CLASSIFICATION Approach to the organization of information with origins in the field of library and information science. Intended to highlight those features of CMC that most directly affect users' linguistic choices.
12. Facets = categories or concepts of the same inherent type. A faceted scheme has several facets and each facet may have several terms or possible values (E.g. Wine.)
13. It's an analytico-synthetic method: a subject domain is firt analyzed into component facets, and relevant facets are then synthesized into combinations to characterise items of interest. The facets don't have to be ordered, nor be of the same type, although they should be clearly defined and mutually exclusive. Its purpose is not to facilitate information storage and retrieval, but to facilitate data selection and analysis in CMD research.
14. 4- THE FACETED CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR CMD Overview of the Faceted Classification Scheme CMD is subject to two basic types of influence medium situation (technological) (social) open ended, unordered, non-hierarchical relationship.
15. Technological features of CMC systems The inclusion of a set of technological factors in the approach does not assume that the computer medium exercises a determining influence on communication in all cases, although each factor has been observed to affect communication in at least some instances. One reason for including medium factors as a separate list is to attempt to discover under what circumstances specific system features affect communication and in what ways.
16. Social factors The inclusion of a set of situation factors assumes that context can shape communication in significant ways, although it does not assume that any given factor is always influential. Categories may or may not interact, just as there may (or may not) be patterned correspondences between medium and situation factors.
17. The categories are realized by more than one possible value. The categories may be heterogenous, with values that are binary, scalar, or a list of discrete items. The scheme may be applied to data samples of almost any size, although not all categories are relevant for very small samples.
18. Medium Factors M1: Synchronicity of articipation Asynchronous systems: users don't have to be logged on at the same time to send and receive messages (email.) Synchronous systems: sender and addressee must be logged on symultaneously (real-time chat.)
19. M2: Message transmission 1-way: message by message; the receiver does not have any indication that the sender is composing a message until it is sent and received, so the receiver can't give simultaneous feedback. 2-way: character by character; the sender and the receiver can see the message as it is produced, so the receiver can give simultaneous feedback. It can alter the structure of turn taking.
20. M3: Persistence of transcript How long messages remain on the system after they are received (email, discussion lists, etc. vs. chat systems.) Greater persistence of CMD heightens meta-linguistic awareness: it allows users to reflect on their communication and keep track of and participate in multiple conversational threads.
21. M4: Size of message buffer It's the number of characters the system allows in a single message (email vs. chat, mobile phones.) Smaller buffers mean shorter messages and different discourse organizational strategies, like abbreviated language.
22. M5: Channels of communication Visual channels: text + graphics/video The presence of video images affected the amount and gender distribution of discourse on an educational website. Audio channels: videoconferencing systems (skype)
23. M6: Anonymous messaging (chats, forums) M7: Private messaging (chats) M8: Filtering (messages) M9: Quoting (emails) It is possible for users to engage in these behaviors without any special technical means, but when such means are available, they facilitate the behaviors, making them more likely to happen.
24. M10: Message format It determines the order in which messages appear, what information is appended automatically to each and how it is visually presented, and what happens when the viewing window becomes filled with messages (chat, forums vs. blogs vs. wikis.)
25. Situation Factors S1: Participation structure One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one Public/private Degree of anonymity/pseudonymity Group size; number of active participants Amount, rate, and balance of participation S2: Participant characteristics Demographics: gender, age, occupation, etc. Proficiency: with language/computers/CMD Experience: with addressee/group/topic Role/status: in real life; of online personae Pre-existing sociocultural knowledge and interactional norms Attitudes, beliefs, ideologies and motivations
26. S3: Purpose Of group, e.g., professional, social, fantasy/role-playing, aesthetic, experimental Goal of interaction, e.g., get information, negotiate consensus, develop professional/social relationships, impress/entertain oters, have fun S4: Topic or theme Of group, e.g., politics, linguistics, feminism, soap operas, sex, science fiction, South Asian culture, pub Of exchanges, e.g., the war in Iraq, the project budget, gay sex, vacation plans, personal information S5: Tone Serious/playful, formal/casual, contentious/friendly, cooperative/sarcastic, etc.
27. S6: Activity Activities are discursive means of pursuing interactional goals. E.g., “debate” as a means of impressing others with one's intellectual insight. S7: Norms Of organization Of social appropriateness Of language
28. S8: Code Language, language variety Font/writing system
29. Medium factors may correlate with situation factors In principle the 8 situation dimensions are independent of one another. In practice, they tend to combine in predictable ways.
