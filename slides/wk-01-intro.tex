\myslide{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item How technology affects our use of language
% (from the effects of encoding to the rise of chatspeak), and also
 \item How language is used on the internet
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Some fun things we can now do, that we couldn't before 
   \end{itemize}
 \item Collaboration and shared authoring
 \item Meta-languages
 \item The Semantic Web
%   Students will gain understanding of the 
% problems of representing, transmitting and transforming language
% electronically.  Specific topics will include automatic parsing and
% generation of language, text mining (extracting knowledge from text)
% and machine translation.
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gain an understanding of how technology affects language use
\item Develop familiarity with markup and meta information in texts
\item Get a feel for what research is all about, especially relating to
  web mining and online frequency counting
\end{itemize}
\subhead{Upon successful completion, students will:}
\begin{itemize}
\item have an understanding of how technology shapes language use
\item be able to test linguistic hypotheses against web data.
\end{itemize}

  \\ --- but surely transferring information is important
\item How can we measure information?

\myslide{Information as bits}

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we have 8 equally likely facts (A, B, C, \ldots H). 
 \\ How many yes-no   questions does it take to pinpoint the fact?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is the information in bits
\\ you need $n$ bits of information
  \end{itemize}
  \item Technically the Entropy %
 \[ H(\mathrm{p}) = -\sum_{x \in X} \mathrm{p}(x)\log_2\mathrm{p}(x) \]
 %\[ H(\mathrm{p}) = -\sum_{x \in X} \mathrm{p}(x)\log_2\mathrm{p}(x) \]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item  We won't go there in HG2052
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\myslide{What if some facts are more common?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Simplified Polynesian:
\\  p ($\frac{1}{8}$);
k ($\frac{1}{8}$);
i ($\frac{1}{8}$);
u ($\frac{1}{8}$);
   t ($\frac{1}{4}$);
   a ($\frac{1}{4}$)
\item We can do this in $2 \frac{1}{2}$ bits
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is it (a or t) or ( p, k, i, u), \ldots
  \end{itemize}
\item We can define a $2 \frac{1}{2}$ bit code 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item p (100); k (101); i (110); u (111); t (00);  a (01)  
  \end{itemize}
\item Which codes are longer --- frequent or infrequent letters?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What does this imply for language?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\citep[\S2.2]{Manning:Schuetze:1999}


\myslide{What if there is mutual information?}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the next letter?
\item What is the next letter following /./?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item [t]
  \item [a]
  \item [q]
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the next letter following /../?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item [th]
  \item [as]
  \item [qu]
  \end{itemize}
\item A language model and more context improves our guess
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Different Models for English}

Consider only 26 lowercase letters and a space, and a language model
based on probability (Hidden Markov Model).  How many guesses do we
need on average to guess the next letter?

\begin{itemize}
\item Zeroth order (random) = $\log_2$ 27 = 4.76
\item First order (frequency) = 4.03 \hfill (pick \textit{e})
\item Second order (one previous letter) = 2.8
\item Human = 1.34
\end{itemize}

Surrounding context helps interpretation


\myslide{What if there is noise?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Imagine you want to send a signal, but randomly a bit gets flipped (noise)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Original message /pa/ 100 01
  \item Received message /ka/ 101 01
  \end{itemize}
\item If we make the message longer, we can guard against this
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Original message /pa/ 100 100 100 01 01 01
  \item Received message /ka/ 101 100 100 01 01 01
\\   We add \blu{redundancy} to the signal
\item There are much better encodings than this (\blu{Hamming codes})
\end{itemize}
\item Hmn lngge s vr rdndnt 
\end{itemize}

\myslide{The cloze test}
\newcommand{\cz}[1]{\hspace*{3em}}

Modern linguistics has been \cz{able} to provide theories and \cz{formalisms}
for the specification of \cz{grammars} that express this mapping \cz{in} a
declarative and transparent \cz{way}. Computational linguistics has
contributed \cz{elaborate} platforms and tools for \cz{grammar} development.

A few large \cz{scale} grammars have been \cz{designed} that exhibit sufficient
\cz{accuracy} and coverage for \cz{real} application tasks. However,\cz{ these}
encouraging developments were \cz{seriously} hampered by a \cz{lack} of methods
for \cz{language} analysis that fulfill \cz{the} minimal requirements in
\cz{efficiency}, robustness, and specificity.

This simply \cz{means} that all \cz{systems} working with \cz{these} grammars have
\cz{been} too slow \cz{and} too brittle \cz{for} real applications. \cz{Furthermore}, they
have \cz{not} been able \cz{to} manage the \cz{vast} ambiguity in \cz{natural} language,
i.e. \cz{they} could not \cz{select} among large \cz{numbers} of linguistically

\begin{itemize}
\item Which message has more information?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ababababababababababab

  \item MDL includes the algorithm and data
  \item it approximates the entropy for long strings
  \end{itemize}
\item The difference between the actual length and the MDL is the redundancy
\item English appears to have more redundancy that Chinese:

\item \txx{Data} is unprocessed facts and figures without any added interpretation or analysis. "The price of crude oil is \$80 per barrel."
\item \txx{Information} is data that has been interpreted so that it has meaning for the user. "The price of crude oil has risen from \$70 to \$80 per barrel" gives meaning to the data and so is said to be information to someone who tracks oil prices.
\item \txx{Knowledge} is a combination of information, experience and insight that may benefit the individual or the organisation. "When crude oil prices go up by \$10 per barrel, it's likely that petrol prices will rise by 2p per litre" is knowledge.
