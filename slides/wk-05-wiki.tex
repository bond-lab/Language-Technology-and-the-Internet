\myslide{Versions, Revisions, Authorship}

\begin{itemize}
\item Many works have multiple versions
\item Before writing, every production was different
\item With writing, every copy was different
\item The same source may have multiple translations
\item Authors (and Editors and Publishers) revise text
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Examples?
  \end{itemize}
\item Computers can store multiple versions together
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Revision Control Systems}

\begin{itemize}
\item Versioning file systems
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  every time a file is opened, a new copy is stored
  \end{itemize}
\item CVS (Concurrent Versioning System), Subversion, Git
  \begin{itemize}
  \item changes to a collection of files are tracked
  \item simultaneous changes are merged
  \item github is a popular interface: \href{https://github.com/fcbond}{github.com/fcbond} 
  \end{itemize}
\item Revision Tracking
  \begin{itemize} 
  \item Revisions are stored within a file (MS Word, Google Docs)
  \end{itemize}
\item Authorship in shared writing (who wrote what?)

\myslide{Collaborative Authoring Strategies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Everyone writes a version and someone merges
\item Pass a file round
\item Have a copy at a shared repository (checkout/commit)
\item Allow simultaneous editing online
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  \blu{the wiki}: a website that allows the easy creation and editing of any number of interlinked web pages via a web browser using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG text editor
  \item Ward Cunningham, the developer of the first wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, originally described it as "the simplest online database that could possibly work."
  \item ``Wiki'' is a Hawaiian word for "fast"
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Does collaborative authoring change language?}

\begin{itemize}
\item No one has measured this (as far as I know)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Are sentences longer/shorter?
  \item Is the writing easier/harder to follow?
  \item Is it more/less pleasant to read?
  \item Does it have more/fewer errors?
  \end{itemize}
  Good topic for FYP/URECA 
\item Collaboration is sometimes in large chunks, sometimes in small
  chunks, sometimes at the level of formatting
\item This is an untapped area of study
\item For computer science, the ability to make changes, share and
  revert easily has made a big difference to how work is done --- I
  think this will also change at least some authorship (my research
  papers are written like this)
\end{itemize}

\section{Wikis and Wikipedia}

\myslide{The original wiki}
\begin{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Nupedia
\item Lowering the barrier to entry
\item Who edits what?
\item Who edits what when?
\item How to ensure quality?
\item Research with Wikipedia
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Nupedia}

\begin{itemize}
\item Build a free encyclopedia written by experts
\\ "true experts in their fields and (with few exceptions) possess PhDs"
\item Nupedia had a seven-step editorial process, consisting of:
\\   1. Assignment;
   2. Finding a lead reviewer;
   3. Lead review;
   4. Open review;
   5. Lead copyediting;
   6. Open copyediting;
   7. Final approval and markup;
 \item Wikipedia was a side-project to allow collaboration on articles prior to entering the peer review process
 \item Nupedia never got beyond 24 articles
 \end{itemize}
 
\myslide{Lowering the barrier to entry}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wikipedia makes it easy to share your knowledge
  \begin{itemize}
    \item People like to do this
  \end{itemize}
\item You don't even have to register
\item Getting content is hard --- so it is crucial that it is easy to add information
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Who writes Wikipedia: the in-crowd}

\begin{itemize}
\item 50\% of all the edits are done by just .7\% of the users (524 people)
\item 73\% of all the edits are done by 2\%  (1,400 people)

\MyLogo{\url{http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia} \textit{the Internet's own boy}}

A close look at one page (\textbf{Alan Alda}):

If you just count edits (7 of the top 10) are registered users who
(all but 2) have made thousands of edits to the site. Indeed, \#4 has
made over 7,000 edits while \#7 has over 25,000.

When you count letters: few of the contributors (2 out of the top 10)
are even registered and most (6 out of the top 10) have made less than
25 edits to the entire site. In fact, \#9 has made exactly one edit —
this one!

A great many people add a bit of content about something they know
about, and a few people make many small changes to make it conform to
wikipedia style.

\myslide{The five pillars of Wikipedia}
\MyLogo{\url{Wikipedia:Five pillars}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia
\item Wikipedia has a neutral point of view.
\item Wikipedia is free content
\item Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner
\item Wikipedia does not have firm rules
\end{enumerate}
\begin{quote}
  the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation, is to get a free
  encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.
\begin{flushright}
  Jimmy Wales TED talk 2006
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

\myslide{Encyclopedia}

\begin{large}
  Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia. It incorporates elements of
  general and specialized encyclopedias, almanacs, and
  gazetteers. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, an advertising platform, a
  vanity press, an experiment in anarchy or democracy, an
  indiscriminate collection of information, or a web directory. It is
  not a dictionary, newspaper, or a collection of source documents;
  that kind of content should be contributed instead to the Wikimedia
  sister projects.
\end{large}
\myslide{NPOV} 

\begin{large}
  Wikipedia has a neutral point of view. We strive for articles that
  advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires
  representing multiple points of view, presenting each point of view
  accurately and in context, and not presenting any point of view as
  "the truth" or "the best view". All articles must strive for
  verifiable accuracy: unreferenced material may be removed, so please
  provide references. Editors' personal experiences, interpretations,
  or opinions do not belong here. That means citing verifiable,
  authoritative sources, especially on controversial topics and when
  the subject is a living person. When conflict arises over
  neutrality, discuss details on the talk page, and follow dispute
  resolution.
\end{large}

\myslide{Free} 

\begin{large}
  Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit and
  distribute. Respect copyright laws. Since all your contributions are
  freely licensed to the public, no editor owns any article; all of
  your contributions can and will be mercilessly edited and
  redistributed.
\end{large}

\begin{itemize}
\item licensed under the \textit{Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Code of conduct and etiquette} 

\begin{large}
  Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil
  manner. Respect and be polite to your fellow Wikipedians, even when
  you disagree. Apply Wikipedia etiquette, and avoid personal
  attacks. Find consensus, avoid edit wars, and remember that there
  are 3,433,839 articles on the English Wikipedia to work on and
  discuss. Act in good faith, never disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a
  point, and assume good faith on the part of others. Be open and
  welcoming.
\end{large}

\myslide{Ignore all rules (IAR)} 

\begin{large}
  Wikipedia does not have firm rules. Rules on Wikipedia are not fixed
  in stone, and the spirit of the rule trumps the letter of the
  rule. Be bold in updating articles and do not worry about making
  mistakes. Your efforts do not need to be perfect; prior versions are
  saved, so no damage is irreparable. However, please respect the
  other pillars.
\end{large}


\myslide{Quality Control}

\begin{itemize}
\item How is quality maintained?
\item Some people regularly check the \blu{new changes} page
\item Many people watch pages of interest to them
\item All information is stored and accessible

\myslide{Wikipedia vs Britannica}
\MyLogo{\url{http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html}}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Nature} study compared 42 articles reviewed by three experts

\item The average scientific entry in Wikipedia contained four errors
  or omissions, while Britannica had three.
\item Of eight ``serious errors'' the reviewers found — including misinterpretations of important concepts — four came from each source
\item Wikipedia is good on pop culture and contemporary technology
  because Wikipedia's stable of dedicated volunteers tend to have more
  collective expertise in such areas.
\item Wikipedia  tends to lag when it comes to topics touching on the humanities 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Techies are on-line more, and share information more readily.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Problems with Wikipedia}
\MyLogo{From \url{http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problems_of_Wikipedia}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Anyone can change an article in Wikipedia. Some articles in
  Wikipedia may not be entirely true and accurate, instead displaying
  a hoax or a false information.
\item In particular, there is a problem of vandalism. Some  is obvious,
  other forms  may be difficult to see.
\item People who have a strong opinion about a subject will try to
  control the articles about that subject.
\item Not all facts are backed by sources, not all sources are
  reliable, and not all are checked.
\item Not all editors are competent or pleasant.

\myslide{Edit Wars}
\MyLogo{}
An edit war occurs when editors who disagree about some aspect of the
content of a page repeatedly override each other's contributions,
rather than try to resolve the disagreement by discussion.

Edit warring is unconstructive and creates animosity between editors,
making it harder to reach a consensus as to the right way to improve
the encyclopedia. Users who engage in edit wars risk being blocked or
even banned from editing.

\emp{The three-revert rule} (3RR): do not perform more than three reverts on a
single page within a 24-hour period. Breaking this rule is
sufficient—but not necessary—to warrant a block for edit warring.

\myslide{Lamest Edit Wars}

\begin{description}
\item [German Wikipedia's Article on Danube Tower]
Is the Danube Tower "an observation tower" or "a television and observation tower"? This edit war was so lame that it got covered in Der Spiegel.
\item [Template:WikiProject Computer science]
58kb of talk page debate plus a user block over how to copyedit a two line statement.
\item [Sea of Japan]
Should it be called the Sea of Japan, the East Sea, or even the East Sea of Korea? Are both names valid, and if so, should the article be named Sea of Japan (East Sea) or Sea of Japan / East Sea? Or is the actual most common English and international name Sea of Japan (East Sea), parentheses and all?

\begin{itemize}
\item [Q]: Why do depositors restrict access to material?
\item [A]: There are a variety of reasons why a depositor might specify an access restriction.  The people they have recorded may specify that they want their material kept safe, but not distributed.  Occasionally depositors restrict access for a limited time until they have checked the material, to see if it is accurate enough for distribution or publication — authors are concerned that inaccurate information may take on a life of its own.  Some information (though only a small fraction of ASEDA holdings) is restricted because it is secret/sacred.
\newpage
\item [Q]: Why do speakers restrict access to material in their languages?
\item [A]: Many speakers of endangered languages consider that their language is their intellectual property, passed down to them from their ancestors.  If it is made freely available to others, then their rights in that language can be diminished.  Usually they do not want strangers to use words and sentences of their languages in an inappropriate way, and want to be consulted prior to public use.
