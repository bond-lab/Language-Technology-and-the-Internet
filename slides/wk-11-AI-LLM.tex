\myslide{Large Language Models}

\begin{itemize}
\item Generative models that capture extended context in order to
  predict the next token (word, sub-word or symbol) 
\item The main innovation is in the sheer size
\item They model how language is used
\item They can appear know a lot about the world
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Humans naturally make meaning of language we encounter and     imagine the mind behind that language
     \begin{itemize}
  \item Artificial agents have limited capacity for communicative intent
  \item And some natural language systems have none
  \end{itemize}
\item Dealing with the risks of language
    technology requires recognizing and accounting for the above

Lambdalabs estimates a cost of around \$4.6 million US dollars and 355 years to train GPT-3 on a single GPU in 2020

\myslide{ChatGPT Intro}

\begin{itemize}
\item The base is generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model
  \\ based on the transformer architecture developed by Google
\item Training data includes software manual pages, bulletin board systems, multiple programming languages, wikipedia, books and more (up to Jan 2022)
  \item Fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination
  of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques from human feedback
\item Interact with a prompt, to which you get a response
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  keeps a context of 4k tokens ($\approx 500$ tokens/A4 page)
  \item  longer context (up to 32k) in newer models
  \end{itemize}
\item Free interface, beyond a certain amount you are charged per
  token
  \\ (from   $\$0.002--\$0.12$/token)        
  
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Prompt Engineering}

The first prompt provides a starting point or direction for ChatGPT. The response follows the same tone, context, and style as the prompt.

\begin{itemize}
\item Start simple - start with a simple prompt and build on it
\item Give a command - start the prompt with an action word like "Write", "Create", or "Summarize" instead of "Can you"
\item Add Context - add specific and relevant context to the task you want to perform
\item Add Expectations - add clear and direct expectations for the content, like how long it should be and what to include
\end{itemize}

\prompt{Create a list of interesting places to visit in Olomouc:\\
  - they should be cheap\\
  - they should be fun}

\myslide{Role Prompting}

A simple way to add context to a prompt is to assign a role to ChatGPT.

\prompt{You are a student.\\
Create a list of interesting places to visit in Olomouc:\\
  - they should be cheap\\
  - they should be fun}

\prompt{You are an artist.\\
Create a list of interesting places to visit in Olomouc:\\
  - they should be cheap\\
  - they should be fun}

\prompt{You are a foodie.\\
Create a list of interesting places to visit in Olomouc:\\
  - they should be cheap\\
  - they should be fun}

\myslide{You can add a lot more information}
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Zero-shot} prompting means providing a prompt with no examples
\prompt{Classify the text into positive, neutral or negative: \\
Text: That shot selection was awesome. \\
Classification: \\
}
\newpage

\item \txx{Few-shot} prompting means you give the system some examples





\prompt{Text: Today the weather is fantastic \\
Classification: Pos \\
Text: The furniture is small. \\
Classification: Neu \\
Text: I don't like your attitude \\
Classification: Neg \\
Text: That shot selection was awful \\
Classification:
\\}

\section{Introduction to Computational Linguistics}

Computational Linguistics is an interdisciplinary field that 
combines knowledge and techniques from linguistics, computer 
science, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology to
understand and model language from a computational perspective.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
For example, computational linguistics can be used to study 
the structure of language at different levels, such as syntax 
and morphology. In syntax, computational linguistics can help 
identify the rules that govern how words are combined to form 
phrases and sentences. For instance, in the sentence "The cat 
chased the mouse", computational linguistics can analyze the 
syntactic structure to identify that "The cat" is the subject,
 "chased" is the verb, and "the mouse" is the object.

Similarly, in morphology, computational linguistics can help 
identify the rules that govern how words are formed from smaller
 units of meaning, called morphemes. For example, in the word
 "unhappiness", computational linguistics can analyze the
morphological structure to identify that "un-" is a prefix 
meaning "not", "-happi-" is the root meaning "happy", and 
"-ness" is a suffix meaning "state of".
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
Overall, computational linguistics provides a powerful set of
tools for analyzing language and understanding its underlying
structure. It has many practical applications, such as natural
language processing, machine translation, and speech recognition,
and continues to be an active area of research and development.

\myslide{Some possible uses}

\begin{itemize}
\item Brainstorming
\item First Draft
\item Find Title

\item Debug
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Brainstorming}

\prompt{What are some unique ideas for activities for 10 five-year-old girls at a birthday party?}

\section{Discussion}

\myslide{LLM pros and cons}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Mainly grammatical text
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For English, although no one knows if it is the same as
      human produced text %\hfill  \txx{We should study this: with DELPH-IN, GWA}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Good at transformation
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Translation
    \item Text to code (quicker but less secure)
    \item Text to image
    \end{itemize}
  \item Very expensive to train
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Only corporations can build the latest models
    \item Uses a lot of computing power
    \item Big carbon footprint
      \\ every month it uses (estimated) 4 M KWh $\approx$ as much as 30 Danes
      \\ to handle  $\approx$ 3,000 million requests!
    \end{itemize}
%%%%% https://towardsdatascience.com/chatgpts-electricity-consumption-7873483feac4
    \newpage
  \item It learns from the web
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A very wide range of knowledge
    \item[\Bad] Including sexist, racist and other toxic language
    \end{itemize}
  \item It does not have a model of the world
    \begin{itemize}
    \item GPT-3 models relationships between words without having an understanding of the meaning behind the utterances
    \item So it makes stuff up (\txx{hallucinates})
      \\ and there is no way of knowing when it is doing so
    \item Fixing this is a hot-topic of research, but there is no clear answer
    \end{itemize}
  \item Some of its training data is copy-righted text
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It is not clear whether this is \txx{legal} (probably) or \\ \emp{ethical}
      (probably not if it can closely reproduce the input text/image/code)
    \item This is especially a problem for visual models
    \end{itemize}
    \newpage
  \item Text produced by a language model is always high-probability text
    \begin{itemize}
    \item So it tends to be blah
    \item The programming is not-elegant
    \item The pictures are derivative
    \end{itemize}
    We may end up being drowned in mediocre AI produced crap
    \begin{itemize}
    \item  SF magazines are already reporting an increase in submissions
    \item \emp{If students can use it to save time, then they will}
    \item \txx{We have to set problems that cannot just be solved using LLMs}
    \item \txx{We should teach students to use it effectively \\
        --- like a calculator for text}
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip
    \item LLMs may become self-aware and super-intelligent and kill all humans
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Unlikely given their lack of understanding or linking to the physical world
    \item They are building some internal models
      \\ but they have no understanding or actual planning
%    \item \emp{Hinton just resigned from Google} 2023-05-01!
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

% \begin{frame}{Possible Research Directions}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Use our current linguistic research to see how close LLM
%     generated text is to human text
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item We can look at syntax
%     \item We can look at word meanings/translations
%     \end{itemize}
%     Interesting but only marginally, need to rerun frequently
%   \item Experiment with using LLMs to automate some linguistic tasks
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Creating Lexicons
%       \begin{itemize}
%       \item I did a small pilot, good for common words in major
%         languages, unreliable for rare words or smaller languages
%       \item Size matters: Chat GPT-3 much, much better than smaller
%         models like Llama or Alpaca
%       \end{itemize}
%     \item I would like to try it for Word Sense Disambiguation
%     \end{itemize}
 
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}
  
% \myslide{Risks and Ethical Issues}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item It will be harder to get funding to do non-neural net
%     computational linguistic research
%     \\ or linguistics or writing or translation, \ldots
%   \item But it still needs to be done
%   \item Building LLMs is fundamentally an engineering problem
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Understanding them is the issue (but requires strong
%       computational skill)
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item Copyright and ownership issues are up in the air
%   \item We need to have a coherent policy on students using LLMs
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Make sure the students have a level playing field
%     \item Make sure they don't use them when they need to practice
%       basic skills
%     \item But allow them to use them when appropriate?
%     \item Similar issue to using machine translation in language classes.
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item I think the research we will do should not pose an existential risk
%   \end{itemize}
